# a summary about you
summary: "I am a passionate data scientist with 6 years of experience analyzing data and creating visualizations. In 2021, I earned a Master's degree in data science and have worked as a data scientist for two years since. My work saved my last company more than $250,000 in consulting fees and labor. My visualizations make data easy to follow, and difficult decisions easier to make."
